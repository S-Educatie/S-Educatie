Hi, this is the official (I guess) GitHub account for education interns at Burgers' Zoo, Arnhem, The Netherlands!
This is where all education interns will host their code and collaborate on projects for the zoo.

My name is Cat, and I am the original author of this readme as of 11/10/2022.
I am an international student at Wageningen University & Research studying for my Master's of Biology, and creating this account was important for my internship.
Being an international student also explains why I have typed in English (mijn Nederlands is niet zo goed), but maybe future interns will translate all of this!
Either way, my internship produced a tool called Plants of the Bush, which is one of the repositories you can find here (I hope).
If that was useful and you would like to contact me to ask questions or otherwise, feel free to send me an email (catherine.sin-nombre@outlook.com).
